# Online Retail Customer Segmentation

This project analyzes an online retail dataset to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By applying RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis combined with K-Means clustering, it identifies distinct customer groups such as high-value, loyal, potential, and at-risk customers. These segments help businesses tailor marketing strategies, improve retention, and drive revenue growth.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy by removing missing values, invalid entries, and duplicates.  
- Feature engineering to compute Recency (days since last purchase), Frequency (number of unique invoices), and Monetary (total spend) per customer.  
- RFM scoring to rank customers into meaningful segments based on quartile distributions.  
- K-Means clustering on scaled RFM data to validate segments and discover natural groupings.  
- PCA-based visualization to illustrate cluster separation and support interpretability.  
- Business insights to prioritize marketing efforts on high-value and loyal customers, and to engage at-risk segments.
